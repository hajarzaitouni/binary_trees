# C - Binary trees
This project is about Implementation of Binary trees in __C programming Language__.

## Geneal
In this project we were able to:
* learne what's a binary tree.
* learn the differrence between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree.
* learn time complexity of the binary tree.
* learn the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree.
* learn what is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.

## Tasks:
0. New node
* In this first task, I'm supposed to create a binary tree node using the following prototype:
	* `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`

1. Insert left
* In this second task, I have create a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node using the following prototye:
	* `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`

2. Insert right
* In this task, I have create a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node using the following prototye:
	* `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`

3. Delete
* In this task, I have create a function that deletes an entire binary tree, using the following prototype:
	* `void binary_tree_delete(binary_tree_t *tree);`

4. Is leaf
* In this task, I have create a function that checks if a node is a leaf, using the following prototype:
	* `int binary_tree_is_leaf(const binary_tree_t *node);`

5. Is root
* In this task, I have create a function that checks if a given node is a root, using the following prototype:
	* `int binary_tree_is_root(const binary_tree_t *node);`
